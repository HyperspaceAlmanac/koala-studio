Timeline based animation system for Core Games

## Create something similar to things such as the animation timeline in other games.
Allow players to edit animations, and then print them out to be copied into other scripts to run.

For now probably limited to in place animation since using IK anchors with a moving body is messy.

## Planned Features

1. Timeline at bottom for body, left arm, right arm, left foot, and right foot.

2. Option to select idle animation or activated ability animation (phases)

3. For idle animamtion, it is a loop. For activated ability, display phaseses.

4. Option to select and play different animations made in this system.

5. Allows users to add key frames. Have menu that opens up to specify things such as anchor weight and offset.

6. Some basic camera functionalities to zoom in / out, and look around.

7. Ability to move the body / limb in real time.

8. Some sort of system to allow for dragging to adjust as well as monitoring for key strokes.
